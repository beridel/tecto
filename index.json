She is a seismologist working on understanding the crustal deformation in the subduction zone beneath Japan. During the PhD at ISTerre (France), her research topic was to monitor the changes in the physical properties of the crust beneath Japan using ambient seismic noise-based monitoring technology. The measured seismic velocity changes are subject to external forcing changes such as the hydrological effects and internal forcing produced by such as different earthquakes. She focuses on the changes of the crustal state before and after the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku-Oki earthquake and finds both dynamic and static strain related seismic velocity reduction. After receiving her PhD from ISTerre, France, she works at ISTerre as a postdoc researcher in 2019 and junior researcher in 2020 on interpreting the 4D tomography beneath Japan. By calculating the different coda waves sensitivity kernels based on the radiative transfer equation model, she can better localize both changes in scattering properties and physical properties in the crust and follow their different evaluation with time. Precise spatial localization is meaningful for a better understanding of the crustal stress state under various impacts.\nNow Qingyu works on the Low-frequency earthquakes in the Nankai region in Japan.

We capture the evolution of the subsurface stress state by monitoring changes in seismic wave velocities over an 11-year period. A sustained long-term increase in seismic velocity that is seasonally modulated drops before the earthquake swarm. We use a three-dimensional hydromechanical model to quantify environmentally driven variations in excess pore pressure, revealing its crucial role in governing the seasonal modulation with a stress sensitivity of 6 × 10−9 per pascal. The decrease in seismic velocity aligns with vertical surface uplift, suggesting potential fluid migration from a high–pore pressure zone at depth. Stress changes induced by abnormally intense snow falls contribute to initiating the swarm through subsequent perturbations to crustal pore pressure.","tags":["triggering","climate","earthquake source","clustering","Japan"],"title":"Untangling the environmental and tectonic drivers of the Noto earthquake swarm in Japan","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Louise Maubant"],"categories":[],"content":" Louise is leaving our group at the end of February to start as a new postdoc at the Australian National University!

This workflow enables the creation of comprehensive earthquake catalogs with low magnitudes of completeness using no or little prior knowledge of the study region. BPMF uses the seismic wavefield backprojection method to construct an initial earthquake catalog that is then densified with matched filtering. BPMF integrates recent machine learning tools to complement physics‐based techniques, and improve the detection and location of earthquakes. In particular, BPMF offers a flexible framework in which machine learning detectors and backprojection can be harmoniously combined, effectively transforming single‐station detectors into multistation detectors. The modularity of BPMF grants users the ability to control the contribution of machine learning tools within the workflow. The computation‐intensive tasks (backprojection and matched filtering) are executed with C and CUDA‐C routines wrapped in Python code. This leveraging of low‐level, fast programming languages and graphic processing unit acceleration enables BPMF to efficiently handle large datasets. Here, we first summarize the methodology and describe the application programming interface. We then illustrate BPMF’s capabilities to characterize microseismicity with a 10 yr long application in the Ridgecrest, California area. Finally, we discuss the workflow’s runtime scaling with numerical resources and its versatility across various tectonic environments and different problems.","tags":["detection","high-performance computing"],"title":"BPMF: A backprojection and matched-filtering workflow for automated earthquake detection and location","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gaspard Farge","Claude Jaupart","William B.

Here, we study how this segmentation reflects large-scale variations of the structure and conditions of the fault interface where tremor is generated. We try to understand which properties of the hydraulic system of the fault allow elementary tremor sources to synchronize, leading to the emergence of long-period, large-scale episodic activity. We model tremor sources as being associated with rapid openings of low-permeability valves in the fault zone, which channels the upward flow of metamorphic fluids. Valve openings cause pressure transients that allow interaction between sources. In such a system, tremor activity is thus controlled by unsteady fluid circulation. Using numerical simulations of fluid flow, we explore the impact of valve spatial distribution and fluid flux on the emergence of large-scale patterns of tremor activity. We show that when valves are densely distributed and submitted to near-critical input flux, they synchronize and generate more episodic activity. Based on our model, the most periodic and spatially coherent tremor bursts should thus be emitted from segments densely populated with valves, and therefore of lower permeability than less synchronized segments. The collective activity of their valve population is responsible for fluid-pressure cycling at the subduction scale. In the tremor zone of Shikoku, Japan, the most temporally clustered segment coincides with a downgoing seamount chain, suggesting that the segmentation of the fault zone permeability, and hence of tremor activity, could be inherited from the topography of the subducting oceanic plate.","tags":["subduction","low-frequency earthquakes","earthquake source","Mexico","fluids"],"title":"Along-strike segmentation of seismic tremor and its relationship with the hydraulic structure of the subduction fault zone","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qingyu Wang"],"categories":[],"content":" Qingyu is leaving our group at the end of November to go back to ISTerre in Grenoble, France!

Here, we use both interferometric radar (InSAR) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data to investigate the plate coupling of the Hikurangi subduction zone beneath the North Island of New Zealand, where multiple slow slip cycles are superimposed on the long-term loading. We estimate the plate coupling across the subduction zone over three multi-year observational periods targeting different stages of the slow slip cycle. Our results highlight the importance of the observational time period when interpreting coupling maps, emphasizing the temporal variability of plate coupling. Leveraging multiple geodetic data sets, we demonstrate how InSAR provides powerful constraints on the spatial resolution of both plate coupling and slow fault slip, even in a region where a dense GNSS network exists.","tags":["slow slip","New Zealand","Hikurangi","subduction","geodesy"],"title":"Imaging the Spatiotemporal Evolution of Plate Coupling With Interferometric Radar (InSAR) in the Hikurangi Subduction Zone","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Louise Maubant","William B.

Well situated to provide clues on the slip regime of this unique faulting environment, their distinctive waveforms reflect either an unusual rupture process or unusually strong attenuation in their source zone. We take advantage of the unique geometry of seismicity in the Nankai Trough to isolate the spectral signature of low-frequency earthquakes after correcting for empirically derived attenuation. We observe that low-frequency earthquake spectra are consistent with the classical earthquake model, yet their rupture duration and stress drop are orders of magnitude different from ordinary earthquakes. We conclude their low-frequency nature primarily results from an atypical seismic rupture process rather than near-source attenuation.","tags":["subduction","low-frequency earthquakes","earthquake source","Japan"],"title":"What makes low-frequency earthquakes low frequency","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Caroline Mouchon","William B.

Accompanying seismic low-frequency earthquakes located precisely in time and space provide an opportunity to image slow slip dynamics at subdaily time scales. Here we show that a high-resolution time history of low-frequency earthquake fault slip alone can reproduce the geodetic record of slow slip that we observe to be dominated by subdaily fault slip dynamics. However, a simple linear model cannot accommodate the complex dynamics present throughout the slow slip cycle, and an analysis of different phases of the slow slip cycle shows that the ratio of geodetic to seismic fault slip varies as a function of time. This suggests that the low-frequency earthquake source region saturates as slow slip grows in moment and area. We propose that rheological heterogeneities at the plate boundary associated with low-frequency earthquakes do not play a significant role in the slow slip rupture process, thus implying that their activity is incidental to the driving aseismic slip.","tags":["slow slip","low-frequency earthquakes","Mexico","subduction","seismo-geodesy"],"title":"Subdaily slow fault slip dynamics captured by low-frequency earthquakes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jade Eyles"],"categories":[],"content":" Jade Eyles, a Postdoctoral Fellow, has joined the Tectonophysics research group this June.

While many geophysical processes span the crust, including volcanic unrest and large-magnitude earthquakes, existing methods for seismic monitoring are limited to the shallow subsurface. We present an approach for deep seismic monitoring based on teleseismic receiver functions, which illuminate the crustal velocity structure from the bottom-up. Using synthetic waveform modeling, we show that receiver functions are uniformly sensitive to velocity changes throughout the crust and can locate the depth of the perturbation. We introduce a novel method based on optimal transport for measuring the nonlinear time-amplitude signal variations characteristic of receiver function monitoring. We show that optimal transport enables comparison of full waveform distributions rather than relying on representative stacked waveforms. We further study a linearized version of optimal transport that renders time-warping signal variations into simple Euclidean perturbations, and use this capability to perform blind source separation in the space of waveform variations. This disentangles the effects of changes in the source-receiver path from changes in subsurface velocities. Collectively, these methods extend the reach of seismic monitoring to deep geophysical processes, and provide a tool that can be used to study heterogeneous velocity changes with different spatial extents and temporal dynamics.","tags":["seismic monitoring","synthetics","receiver functions","optimal transport"],"title":"Capturing seismic velocity changes in receiver functions with optimal transport","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ayako Tsuchiyama","Jared Bryan","Caroline Mouchon"],"categories":[],"content":" Ayako, Jared and Caroline went to the Seismology Student Workshop at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (Colombia University, USA), a two-day workshop organized by and for graduate students.

Therefore, velocity changes (dv/v) inferred from ambient noise interferometry allow remotely assessing the damage state of the slope. However, the time scale and amplitude of the dv/v evolution associated with the slope destabilizations are not well known, and their detection and characterization require both high precision and high temporal resolution in dv/v. We herein report an in-situ one-year monitoring of the dv/v on the slow-moving Pubugou rock slope with a high temporal resolution up to 20-min by using two seismic stations in the mountainous region of Sichuan, China, where the slope is affected by both earthquakes and rainfall. The results confirm the feasibility of (1) detecting a possible precursor dv/v drop (−0.5%) ∼40 min before a slope destabilization; (2) characterizing the dv/v caused by the superimposed effects of moderate earthquakes and rainfall; and (3) quantifying the daily dv/v fluctuations of the slope caused by the environmental thermal forcing through thermoelastic effects. In addition, the measurement error and the detectable depth resolution of the dv/v are also addressed in this study. Finally, we suggest the high-resolution technique as a complementary means to be used for operational rock slope damage surveillance in the future.","tags":["in-situ","rock slope","precursors","seismic interferometry"],"title":"In-situ monitoring of rock slope destabilization with ambient seismic noise interferometry in southwest China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Louise Maubant"],"categories":[],"content":" Louise visited and a gave talk at the Geophysical Institute at the University of Alaska Fairbanks!\n","date":1668643200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668643200,"objectID":"6ffd6416b63db3c63a7bfe067d4e27c4","permalink":"https://eqsci.mit.edu/tecto/post/talk_maubant_nov2022/","publishdate":"2022-11-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tecto/post/talk_maubant_nov2022/","section":"post","summary":"Louise visited and a gave talk at the Geophysical Institute at the University of Alaska Fairbanks!","tags":["Talk"],"title":"Louise gave a talk at University of Alaska Fairbanks","type":"post"},{"authors":["Louise Maubant","Caroline Mouchon","William B.

A typical step in analyzing Noise Cross-correlation Functions (NCFs) is stacking short-term NCFs over longer time periods to increase the signal quality. Spurious NCFs could contaminate the stack, degrade its quality, and limit its use. Many methods have been developed to improve the stacking of coherent waveforms, including earthquake waveforms, receiver functions, and NCFs. This study systematically evaluates and compares the performance of eight stacking methods, including arithmetic mean or linear stacking, robust stacking, selective stacking, cluster stacking, phase-weighted stacking, time-frequency phase-weighted stacking, Nth-root stacking, and averaging after applying an adaptive covariance filter. Our results demonstrate that, in most cases, all methods can retrieve clear ballistic or first arrivals. However, they yield significant differences in preserving the phase and amplitude information. This study provides a practical guide for choosing the optimal stacking method for specific research applications in ambient noise seismology. We evaluate the performance using multiple onshore and offshore seismic arrays in the Pacific Northwest region. We compare these stacking methods for NCFs calculated from raw ambient noise (referred to as Raw NCFs) and from ambient noise normalized using a one-bit clipping time normalization method (referred to as One-bit NCFs). We evaluate six metrics, including signal-to-noise ratios, phase dispersion images, convergence rate, temporal changes in the ballistic and coda waves, relative amplitude decays with distance, and computational time. We show that robust stacking is the best choice for all applications (velocity tomography, monitoring, and attenuation studies) using Raw NCFs. For applications using One-bit NCFs, all methods but phase-weighted and Nth-root stacking are good choices for seismic velocity tomography. Linear, robust, and selective stacking methods are all equally appropriate choices when using One-bit NCFs for monitoring applications. For applications relying on accurate relative amplitudes, the linear, robust, selective, and cluster stacking methods all perform well with One-bit NCFs. The evaluations in this study can be generalized to a broad range of time-series analysis that utilizes data coherence to perform ensemble stacking. Another contribution of this study is the accompanying open-source software, which can be used for general purposes in time-series stacking.","tags":["ambient noise","seismic monitoring","review"],"title":"Optimal Stacking of Noise Cross-Correlation Functions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ayako Tsuchiyama","Caroline Mouchon"],"categories":[],"content":" Ayako and Caroline went to the Slow-to-Fast Earthquakes workshop in Nara (Japan), an international workshop organized by Tokyo University to gather scientists specialised in Fast and Slow Earthquakes.

Seismicity in the deep Earth can provide essential information on the physical processes that control fluid distribution within the mantle, yet the mechanism of deep earthquakes is still enigmatic.\nDeep earthquakes are categorized into two groups depending on the depth. Intermediate-depth earthquakes generally occur at the depth range of 70-300 km, then deep-focus earthquakes continue from 300 km.\nIn our research group, we focus on intermediate-depth earthquakes in Colombia. The region shows “a nest of earthquakes” where intermediate-depth earthquakes densely occur within the 10-km cube. The Bucaramanga Nest in Colombia is one of the most productive areas of intermediate-depth earthquakes on Earth. We are curious about the mechanism of triggering many earthquakes in a limited volume within subduction slabs.\nCurrently, we are working on building a systematic catalog of earthquakes in the Bucaramanga Nest. The goal of our initial project is to detect smaller events that have not been identified in the original catalog by SGC to understand the background seismicity. After completing the catalog making, we will work on spectral analyses to find differences between regular earthquakes in shallow regions, slow-slip events in subduction zones, and other deep earthquakes in different regions. By comparing the source spectra, we will identify the fundamental mechanism of deep earthquakes.\nAyako was previously working on deep-focus earthquakes in Japan.

Those slow earthquakes play a major role in the earthquake cycle, but their physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. New methods and multi-disciplinary focused studies allow us now to expand our frontier in slow earthquake science complexity and diversity. We use geophysical methods such as InSAR analysis, geodetic solutions, and seismic catalogs as our main research tools to explore this field.\nSubdaily dynamics of slow slip Reproducing geodetic aseismic fault slip from low-frequency earthquake time history at high sampling rates\nSlow slip events were first discovered in the early 2000s as a long-lasting release of energy visible on continuous surface motion as a reverse of the direction of motion of the GNSS station. While slow slip events are still mostly observed using GNSS surface motion, geodetic measurement only capture their long spatial- and temporal-wavelength behavior. Low-frequency earthquakes, small repeating earthquakes on the plate boundary, are often spatiotemporally correlated with slow slip, giving us the opportunity to explore slow slip dynamics at shorter time scales. Many studies highlighted the existence of a short time scale component in the complex dynamics of slow slip events using both seismic and geodetic datasets. Here, we are focusing our research on two main questions: (1) To what extent can we use low-frequency earthquake activity history to learn about slow slip short time scale dynamics? (2) What is the relationship between the aseismic slip observed by geodetic observables and the seismic slip associated with low-frequency earthquakes?\nOur project focuses on slow slip events happening in the Guerrero region of the Mexican Subduction zone. This area is a \u0026ldquo;seismic gap\u0026rdquo;, where large megathrust earthquakes have not occurred during the last century. Because of its specific flat geometry, the rheological conditions in this region allows the occurrence of large Mw7.5 slow slip events every 4 years, and smaller Mw6.4 every more frequently. The deployement of a large seismic network crossing all Mexico between 2005 and 2008 give us the opportunity to study the seismic activity associated to the large Mw7.5 2006 slow slip event recorded by GNSS stations.\nWe explore those previous questions in this context by creating a simple fault slip model using both geodetic and seismic observables. This model is driven by the time history of low-frequency earthquakes at both daily and subdaily time scales to reproduce the geodetic record of the slow slip cycle including the large 2006 slow slip event of Guerrero. This simple approach reveals the limits of low-frequency earthquakes as a proxy to study slow slip. The slow slip cycle can be tracked by low-frequency earthquakes only when looking at individual phases of the cycle, whereas trying to modelise a full slow slip cycle needs a more complex approach. A non-linear relationship is needed between the aseismic and seismic fault slip to represent all the different phases of this slow slip cycle. We also observe that long-term loading rates on the order of plate convergence are necessary for our models to fit well the geodetic fault slip, implying 100% coupling on the plate interface at short time scales.\nInteraction with earthquakes Sous-sous-titre: blabla\nBlabla Louise\nRole in seismic cycle Sous-sous-titre: blabla\nBlabla Louise \u0026amp; caro\nWhat makes low-frequency earthquakes low frequency? The roles of attenuation and source\nLow-frequency earthquakes, atypical seismic events distinct from regular earthquakes, occur downdip of the seismogenic megathrust where an aseismic rheology dominates the subduction plate boundary. The spectra of low-frequency earthquakes are consistent with the classical earthquake model, yet their rupture duration and stress drop are orders of magnitude different from ordinary earthquakes.\nimage caption: (Spatiotemporal behavior and spectra of low-frequency and regular earthquakes in the Nankai Trough. (modified from Wang et al., 2023, under review) The Nankai Trough, where low frequency earthquakes were first observed, is monitored by a long-term borehole monitoring network that has recorded low-frequency earthquakes in the same epicentral area as both crustal and intraslab earthquakes. We focus on two depth columns directly beneath two seismic stations where the subduction interface is sandwiched between earthquakes above and below, with one depth column hosting low-frequency earthquakes and the other not. With this unique seismic geometry, we investigate the endmember possibilities of attenuation experienced by low-frequency earthquakes to isolate their source process. Through this natural controlled experiment, we place key constraints on the character of the low-frequency earthquake source to address the outstanding question: what makes low-frequency earthquakes low frequency?\nWe observe that the source regions of the low frequency earthquakes are marked by high pore fluid pressure indicated by high Qp/Qs and Vp/Vs ratios. This suggests that local variations in the rheology of this transitional zone, just downdip of where major earthquakes occur and where slow fault slip dominates the tectonic slip budget, are responsible for earthquakes that rupture an order of magnitude more slowly than is typical. An atypical rupture mechanism associated with this rheology, likely governed by processes linked to saturated fault conditions at the plate boundary, is necessary to explain the low-frequency earthquake source. We conclude their low-frequency nature primarily results from an atypical seismic rupture process rather than near-source attenuation. Attenuation is not what makes low-frequency earthquakes low frequency.\n","date":1661385600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661385600,"objectID":"ae6aa583728d5a09a92accd6c884e49a","permalink":"https://eqsci.mit.edu/tecto/research/slow_earthquakes/","publishdate":"2022-08-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tecto/research/slow_earthquakes/","section":"research","summary":"Earthquake sciences changed significantly in the past decades with, in particular, the discovery of slow-deformation processes in addition to ordinary earthquakes.

This complexity emphasizes the need for detailed images of magma storage, as well as continuous monitoring of magma transport. We are developing new observational methods to capture the 4D evolution of active magmatic plumbing systems.\nSeismic Monitoring of Magmatic Systems Measuring seismic velocity changes from the magma source to the surface Most volcanic activity is driven by influx of melt from the mantle, but geophysical methods like seismic velocity monitoring are often only sensitive to the uppermost crust. Furthermore, few earthquakes occur in the lower crust and most magma transport is aseismic, so our observations of active processes at the roots of magmatic systems are sparse. We developed a seismic monitoring method based on teleseismic receiver functions which can sense velocity changes throughout the crust and does not require local sources.\nWe applied this receiver function monitoring approach to a quiescent period at Mount St. Helens. Taking advantage of the subduction zone setting of the volcano, our strategy is to measure the volcano\u0026rsquo;s response to periodic external forcing from slow slip events on the Cascadia megathrust. The idea is that magma-rich materials will be weaker and more sensitive to external forcing, so measuring the velocity change can act as a probe for the rheology of different parts of the magmatic plumbing system. We plan to apply this method next to an active volcano with mutliple instrumented eruptions. This will allow us to track magma transport and storage from the mantle source to the upper crustal magma chambers. Our goal is to gain new insight into deep magma transport and storage, and to link these processes to signs of impending eruptions.\n","date":1660035600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660035600,"objectID":"70b322c93ac7f03fda12094c1bbe16cc","permalink":"https://eqsci.mit.edu/tecto/research/volcanoes/","publishdate":"2022-08-09T09:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tecto/research/volcanoes/","section":"research","summary":"Reliable forecasts of volcanic activity rely on observations of where magma is stored within the lithosphere and how it migrates from its mantle source towards the surface.

These nearly identical seismic waveforms are usually obtained either from repeated earthquake waveforms or from repeated ambient noise cross-correlations. The five algorithms that are the most popular to measure phase shifts in the coda waves are the windowed cross correlation (WCC), trace stretching (TS), dynamic time warping (DTW), moving window cross spectrum (MWCS) and wavelet cross spectrum (WCS). The seismic wave speed perturbation is then obtained from the linear regression of phase shifts with their respective lag times under the assumption that the velocity perturbation is homogeneous between (virtual or active) source and receiver. We categorize these methods into the time domain (WCC, TS, DTW), frequency domain (MWCS) and wavelet domain (WCS). This study complements this suite of algorithms with two additional wavelet-domain methods, which we call wavelet transform stretching (WTS) and wavelet transform DTW, wherein we apply traditional stretching and DTW techniques to the wavelet transform. This work aims to verify, validate, and test the accuracy and performance of all methods by performing numerical experiments, in which the elastic wavefields are solved for in various 2-D heterogeneous half-space geometries. Through this work, we validate the assumption of a linear increase in phase shifts with respect to phase lags as a valid argument for fully homogeneous and laterally homogeneous velocity changes. Additionally, we investigate the sensitivity of coda waves at various seismic frequencies to the depth of the velocity perturbation. Overall, we conclude that seismic wavefields generated and recorded at the surface lose sensitivity rapidly with increasing depth of the velocity change for all source–receiver offsets. However, measurements made over a spectrum of seismic frequencies exhibit a pattern such that wavelet methods, and especially WTS, provide useful information to infer the depth of the velocity changes.","tags":["ambient noise","seismic monitoring","synthetics","review"],"title":"Numerical comparison of time-, frequency- and wavelet-domain methods for coda wave interferometry","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mathilde Wimez","William B.

In such a way, our proposed method overcomes the matched-filter search’s strictest constraint: that an event must already be identified to detect other similar events.

Rayleigh wave velocity information from the vertical and radial components was extracted in the form of group and phase velocity dispersion curves, whereas the transverse component provided complimentary Love wave velocity information. The multicomponent Rayleigh wave measurements (ZZ, RR, ZR, and RZ) were averaged and used to infer the measurement uncertainties. The Rayleigh and Love wave group and phase velocities were then regionalized in space using a 2D deterministic tomography. A transect that spans the West Antarctic rift system was extracted from the tomography at individual periods between 7 and 60 s for the four types of surface wave velocities (i.e., Rayleigh and Love phase and group velocities). A transdimensional Bayesian joint inversion algorithm was used to invert these four datasets for a 1D model of isotropic shear‐wave velocity versus depth at each point along the transect. In this way, surface wave dispersion curves from multicomponent noise correlations were used to build a 2D isotropic shear‐wave velocity model down to ∼55 km depth. In this model, the top of the large low‐velocity zone beneath Marie Byrd Land was imaged (up to a 5% decrease in velocity at ∼50 km depth), which provides further evidence for a mantle hot spot beneath the crust that supports the high topography in this region. We also observed a large velocity contrast in the lower crust beneath Marie Byrd Land at a depth where previous long‐period seismicity has been observed. This strong contrast occurs more shallow than in previous crustal models, which compared to our model identify a deeper Moho (∼5–10 km deeper) beneath Marie Byrd Land. This new model has implications for interpreting earthquake locations in this region and perhaps necessitates that we revisit past hypocenter estimation studies using updated velocity models for the region.","tags":["antarctica","structure","volcano"],"title":"Crustal structure across the West Antarctic rift system from multicomponent ambient noise surface wave tomography","type":"publication"},{"authors":["William B.

To better constrain this pre-seismic stage, we create a dense seismic catalog via template matching to analyze the precursory phase of the Mw 6.1 L’Aquila earthquake that occurred in central Italy in 2009. We estimate several physical parameters in time, such as the coefficient of variation, the seismic moment release, the effective stress drop, and analyze spatio-temporal patterns to study the evolution of the sequence and the earthquake interactions. We observe that the precursory phase experiences multiple accelerations of the seismicity rate that we divide into two main sequences with different signatures and features: the first part exhibits weak earthquake interactions, quasi-continuous moment release, slow spatial migration patterns, and a lower effective stress drop, pointing to aseismic processes. The second sequence exhibits strong temporal clustering, fast seismicity expansion, and a larger effective stress drop typical of a stress transfer process. We interpret the differences in seismicity behaviors between the two sequences as distinct physical mechanisms that are controlled by different physical properties of the fault system. We conclude that the L’Aquila earthquake is preceded by a complex preparation, made up of different physical processes over different time scales on faults with different physical properties.","tags":["aftershocks","foreshocks","statistics","triggering","earthquake triggering","clustering"],"title":"Tracking the Spatio-Temporal Evolution of Foreshocks Preceding the Mw 6.1 2009 L’Aquila Earthquake","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Florent Aden-Antoniow","seydoux","William B.

The background seismicity rate, or rate of earthquakes that are not directly triggered by other earthquakes, directly relates to the stressing rate, a crucial quantity for understanding the seismic hazards. Determining the background seismicity rate is challenging because aftershock sequences may dominate the seismicity rate. Classifying these events in earthquake catalogs — known as catalog declustering — is a common practice amd most declustering solutions rely on spatio-temporal distances between events, such as the nearest-neighbor-distance algorithm, widely used in various contexts. This algorithm assumes that the nearest-neighbor distance follows a bimodal distribution related to the background seismicity and to the aftershocks. Constraining these two distributions is crucial to distinguish the aftershocks from the background events accurately. Recent work often uses linear splitting based on the nearest-neighbor distance, ignoring the potential overlap between the two populations and resulting in a biased identification of background earthquakes and aftershock sequences. We revisit this problem with machine-learning algorithms. After testing several popular algorithms, we show that a random forest trained with various synthetic catalogs generated by an Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence model outperforms approaches such as k-means, Gaussian-mixture models, and support vector machine classification. We apply our model to two different earthquake catalogs: the relocated Southern California earthquake center catalog and the GeoNet catalog of New Zealand. Our model capably adapts to these two different tectonic contexts, highlighting the differences in aftershock productivity between crustal and intermediate depth-seismicity.","tags":["aftershocks","statistics","triggering","earthquake triggering","clustering"],"title":"An adaptable random forest model for the declustering of earthquake catalogs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Allen Husker","Jorge C Castellanos","Xyoli Pérez-Campos","Raúl W Valenzuela","William B.

The anisotropy is observed in three separate horizontal layers using a novel technique with receiver functions.

The tectonic tremor is located in two zones: (1) the Sweet Spot where most of the tremor is observed (∼160 km – 180 km from the coast) and (2) the Transient Zone (∼80 km – 110 km from the coast). Anisotropy within each layer is observed to be different within each of the tremor zones than just outside them. The changes are explained as due to hydration within those zones. Water releasing phase changes have previously been modelled to occur within those two zones in the subducted slab (Manea \u0026 Manea, 2011). Water rising through each of the layers should generate the observed differences in anisotropy in those zones as the fast polarization direction and split times can differ between dry and hydrated material.

While the mechanism causing this depletion of the high-frequency content of their signal is still debated, this feature may indicate that the source processes at the origin of LFEs are different from those for regular earthquakes. Key constraints on the LFE-generating physical mechanisms can be obtained by establishing scaling laws between their seismic moment and source durations. Here we apply a simple spectral analysis method to the S-waveforms of LFEs from Guerrero, Mexico to measure their seismic moments and corner frequencies, a proxy to source duration. We find characteristic values of $M_0 ∼$ 3 x 10$^{12}$ N.m ($M_w ∼$ 2.3) and $f_c ∼$ 3.0 Hz with the corner frequency very weakly dependent on the seismic moment. This moment-duration scaling observed for Mexican LFE is similar to one previously reported in Cascadia and is very different from the established one for regular earthquakes.

During the year preceding this event, at least three clusters of seismic activity have been reported: in July 2013 and January and March 2014. Recent studies have proposed large-scale slab deformation as a potential trigger for the megathrust earthquake, and these clusters possibly indicate aseismic slip transients accompanying the progressive destabilization of the plate contact. However, no evidence of gradual unlocking of the interface or transient deformation has yet been found in the seismicity rate. To address this question, we develop a dense earthquake catalog covering 15 months preceding the mainshock and derived from the continuous waveform data set recorded by the Integrated Plate Boundary Observatory Chile (IPOC) and Iquique Local Network (ILN) networks. After declustering the seismicity, a space-time analysis highlights a large-scale acceleration of the seismicity along the interface accompanied by a deceleration of intermediate-depth earthquakes. We demonstrate the existence of a seismic quiescence downdip of the mainshock rupture before the July 2013 cluster. We propose that this seismic quiescence potentially highlights fluid circulation and/or aseismic motion along upper-plate crustal fault(s).","tags":["subduction","statistics","precursors","Chile"],"title":"Statistical evidence of a seismic quiescence before the M$_w$8.1 Iquique earthquake, Chile","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Romain Jolivet","William B.

In southern Chile, triggered tremor was observed around an ambient tremor active zone in the Chile triple junction region.

In central Colombia, triggered tremor may be associated with the Romeral fault system rather than the subduction zone interface. In addition, we summarize global observations of tremor-triggering stress and background ambient tremor activity in 24 tremor-active regions. Based on the global summary of triggered and ambient tremor activity, the relative lack of triggered tremor in central and northern Chile and Peru is consistent with the lack of background tremor activity in these regions, suggesting tectonic tremor occurs only in isolated regions along major faults.","tags":["tectonic tremor","subduction","Chile","triggering"],"title":"Isolated Triggered Tremor Spots in South America: Southern Chile, Ecuador, and Central Colombia","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Academic Academic | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne **Two** Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?

This allows for an unprecedented long-term analysis of tectonic tremor in Mexico over multiple slow slip events (SSEs). We only detect tremor that are within previously discovered tremor regions, thereby extending the catalog in time but not space. The resulting catalog demonstrates the strong correlation of bursts of tremor activity and aseismic slip over multiple slow slip cycles. The $M ∼$ 7 long-term SSEs in the states of Guerrero and Oaxaca are associated with the longest sequences of tremor bursts. Each of these tremor bursts are made up of a series of smaller bursts. In between the large $M 7$ SSEs, there are shorter-duration, isolated tremor bursts. In Guerrero, these shorter bursts were found to accompany $M ∼$ 6 short-term SSEs. The occurrence of these short-duration tremor bursts in Oaxaca demonstrates that small short-term SSEs occur in both major slow slip regions in Mexico. The discrete range of tremor burst sizes and rates suggests that slow slip events in the Mexican subduction zone are organized into characteristic moment and moment rates. The catalog also reveals other aseismic transients, such as postseismic slip in Oaxaca after the 16 February 2018 $M_w$ 7.2 Pinotepa Nacional earthquake. We highlight that such long-term catalogs are a useful tool together with geodetic observations to monitor slow slip activity that potentially plays a role in the subduction megathrust cycle.","tags":["tectonic tremor","subduction","Mexico","detection"],"title":"Characteristic tectonic tremor activity observed over multiple slow slip cycles in the Mexican subduction zone","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://eqsci.mit.edu/tecto/contact/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tecto/contact/","section":"","summary":"Contact information","tags":null,"title":"Contact","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://eqsci.mit.edu/tecto/people/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tecto/people/","section":"","summary":"Group members, visitors, and alumni","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["Hugo Perfettini","William B.

We investigate the preparatory phase of this eruption via a statistical analysis of the temporal behavior of long-period (LP) earthquakes that occurred beneath this volcanic system. The LP seismicity occurs close to the surface beneath the main volcanic edifices and at 30 km depth in the vicinity of a deep magmatic reservoir. The deep LP earthquakes and those beneath the Klyuchevskoy volcano occur quasi-periodically, while the LP earthquakes beneath Tolbachik are clustered in time. As the seismicity rate increased beneath Tolbachik days before the eruption, the level of the time clustering decreased. We interpret this as a manifestation of the evolution of the volcano plumbing system. We suggest that when a plumbing system awakes after quiescence, multiple cracks and channels are reactivated simultaneously and their interaction results in the strong time clustering of LP earthquakes. With time, this network of channels and cracks evolves into a more stable state with an overall increased permeability, where fluids flow uninhibited throughout the plumbing system except for a few remaining impediments that continue to generate seismic radiation. The inter-seismic source interaction and the level of earthquake time clustering in this latter state is weak. This scenario suggests that the observed evolution of the statistical behavior of the shallow LP seismicity beneath Tolbachik is an indicator of the reactivation and consolidation of the near-surface plumbing system prior to the Tolbachik eruption. The parts of the plumbing system above the deep magmatic reservoir and beneath the Klyuchevskoy volcano remain in nearly permanent activity, as demonstrated by the continuous occurrence of the deep LP earthquakes and very frequent Klyuchevskoy eruptions. This implies that these parts of the plumbing system remain in a stable permeable state and contain a few weakly interacting seismogenic sources. Our results provide new constraints on future mechanical models of the magmatic plumbing systems and demonstrate that the level of time clustering of LP earthquakes can be a useful parameter to infer information about the state of the plumbing system.","tags":["volcano","Kamchatka","statistics","clustering"],"title":"Progressive reactivation of the volcanic plumbing system beneath Tolbachik volcano (Kamchatka, Russia) revealed by long-period seismicity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hugo Perfettini","William B.

One of the model assumptions is that aftershocks are triggered when a critical level of afterslip is reached. We predict that the migration velocity $V_p$ at time $t$ following the mainshock is given by $V_p = ζ fracA'δτtimes fracct$, where $A'$ is a frictional parameter, $δτ$ a characteristic value for the stress perturbation, $c$ the radius of the stress perturbation, and $ζ$ a constant of order unity. The scaling $V_p = 1/t$ implies a logarithmic expansion of the aftershock zone with time.

The Earthscope Transportable Array (TA) increased the density of broadband seismometers in New England from 2013 until 2015, allowing for a higher resolution characterization of the regional seismicity. During this time, there were two transient increases in seismicity rates in Connecticut: one in August 2014 near the town of Deep River and one shortly after in January 2015 near Plainfield. Using the TA stations along with regional permanent stations, we implement a network-based matched-filter search to find events that have escaped previous detection during these bursts of seismicity. Applying a matched-filter approach in a region of sparse seismicity with a distributed regional network presents two challenges. First, a standard matched-filter search imposes a fixed template event duration across the seismic network; this constraint is not appropriate for the waveforms of shallow crustal seismicity that vary significantly with epicentral distance. We adapt the matched-filter algorithm to produce a network correlation coefficient sum that is properly weighted by the duration of the seismic wavetrain that varies across the network. Second, the low seismicity means there are few events to use as templates. We develop a recursive method to expand the catalog using newly identified earthquakes as template events in the following iteration of the matched-filter search. With these improvements in place, we are able to implement a matched-filter search that identifies three times more events than the regional catalog. Thanks to our denser catalog and precise relative locations, we observe an aftershock sequence following an $M$ 2.6 mainshock near Deep River and a swarmlike sequence without any clear mainshock in Plainfield.","tags":["intraplate","detection","East Coast"],"title":"Adapting the matched-filter search to a wide-aperture network: an aftershock sequence and an earthquake swarm in Connecticut","type":"publication"},{"authors":["William B.

Their focal mechanism and location consistent with shear failure on the plate interface argue for a model where LFEs are discrete dynamic ruptures in an otherwise slowly slipping interface. SSEs are mostly observed by surface geodetic instruments with limited resolution and it is likely that only the largest ones are detected. The time synchronization of LFEs and SSEs suggests that we could use the recorded LFEs to constrain the evolution of SSEs, and notably of the geodetically-undetected small ones. However, inferring slow slip rate from the temporal evolution of LFE activity is complicated by the strong temporal clustering of LFEs. Here we apply dedicated statistical tools to retrieve the temporal evolution of SSE slip rates from the time history of LFE occurrences in two subduction zones, Mexico and Cascadia, and in the deep portion of the San Andreas fault at Parkfield. We find temporal characteristics of LFEs that are similar across these three different regions. The longer term episodic slip transients present in these datasets show a slip rate decay with time after the passage of the SSE front possibly as $t^-1/4$. They are composed of multiple short term transients with steeper slip rate decay as $t^-α$ with $α$ between 1.4 and 2. We also find that the maximum slip rate of SSEs has a continuous distribution. Our results indicate that creeping faults host intermittent deformation at various scales resulting from the imbricated occurrence of numerous slow slip events of various amplitudes.","tags":["subduction","transform","low-frequency earthquakes","statistics","Mexico","San Andreas","Cascadia"],"title":"Imbricated slip rate processes during slow slip transients imaged by low-frequency earthquakes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Baptiste Rousset","Michel Campillo","Cécile Lasserre","William B.

Independent seismological observations of tremors or low-frequency earthquakes and repeating earthquakes provide evidence of low-amplitude slow deformation but do not always coincide with clear occurrences of transient signals in geodetic time series. Here we aim to extract the signal corresponding to slow slips hidden in the noise of GPS time series, without using information from independent data sets. We first build a library of synthetic slow slip event templates by assembling a source function with Green's functions for a discretized fault. We then correlate the templates with postprocessed GPS time series. Once the events have been detected in time, we estimate their duration $T$ and magnitude $M_w$ by modeling a weighted stack of GPS time series. An analysis of synthetic time series shows that this method is able to resolve the correct timing, location, $T$ , and $M_w$ of events larger than $M_w$ 6 in the context of the Mexico subduction zone. Applied on a real data set of 29 GPS time series in the Guerrero area from 2005 to 2014, this technique allows us to detect 28 transient events from $M_w$ 6.3 to 7.2 with durations that range from 3 to 39 days. These events have a dominant recurrence time of 40 days and are mainly located at the downdip edges of the $M_w \u003e$ 7.5 slow slip events.","tags":["Mexico","subduction","seismo-geodesy","slow slip","low-frequency earthquakes","detection"],"title":"A geodetic matched-filter search for slow slip with application to the Mexico subduction zone","type":"publication"},{"authors":["William B.

Recent studies have appealed to a model that suggests that the aseismic slip on the plate interface following the mainshock can be the driving factor in aftershock sequences, reproducing both the geodetic (afterslip) and seismic (aftershocks) observables of postseismic deformation. Exploiting this model, we demonstrate how a dense catalog of aftershocks following the 2015 $M_w$ 8.3 Illapel earthquake in Central Chile can constrain the frictional and rheological properties of the creeping regions of the subduction interface. We first expand the aftershock catalog via a 19 month continuous matched-filter search and highlight the log-time expansion of seismicity following the mainshock, suggestive of afterslip as the main driver of aftershock activity. We then show how the time history of aftershocks can constrain the temporal evolution of afterslip. Finally, we use our dense aftershock catalog to estimate the rate and state rheological parameter $(a ? b) σ$ as a function of depth and demonstrate that this low value is compatible either with a nearly velocity-neutral friction ($a ≈ b$) in the regions of the megathrust that host afterslip, or an elevated pore fluid pressure (low effective normal stress $σ$) along the plate interface. Our results present the first snapshot of rheology in depth together with the evolution of the tectonic stressing rate along a plate boundary. The framework described here can be generalized to any tectonic context and provides a novel way to constrain the frictional properties and loading conditions of active faults.","tags":["Chile","subduction","postseismic","afterslip","aftershocks","rate-state friction","seismo-geodesy"],"title":"Mapping the rheology of the Central Chile subduction zone with aftershocks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["William B.

In such a way, previously undetected slow slip events that produce less than a millimeter of surface deformation are extracted from the geodetic noise.

We apply an automatic burst detection algorithm to the LFE recurrence times to identify the clustering behaviour of LFEs (LFE bursts) in each family.

Generally, the northern group has longer burst duration but fewer LFEs per burst, while the southern group has shorter burst duration but more LFEs per burst. The southern group LFE bursts are generally more correlated than the northern group, suggesting more coherent deep fault slip and relatively simpler deep fault structure beneath the locked section of SAF. We also found that the 2004 Parkfield earthquake clearly increased the number of LFEs per burst and average burst duration for both the northern and the southern groups, with a relatively larger effect on the northern group.

Their occurrence is likely associated with the near-lithostatic pore pressure in the slow earthquake source region, where fluids might modify fault friction and whose presence is indicated by high ratios of compressional (P)?wave velocity to shear (S)?wave velocity observed at the interface between the subducting plate and the overlying crust. Here we compare two slow earthquake phenomena observed in the Guerrero region of the Mexican subduction zone: low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) and a slow-slip event (SSE) recorded by GPS. We observe variations of the LFE occurrence rates over month-long time scales during a large SSE that we interpret as a manifestation of transient changes in the fault shear strength. We argue that these transient changes are caused by a pore pressure fluctuation that migrates updip along the subduction interface. This mechanism suggests that fluids do not only passively weaken the plate interface but also play an active role in slow earthquake source regions.","tags":["subduction","low-frequency earthquakes","slow slip","fluids","Mexico"],"title":"Along-fault pore-pressure evolution during a slow-slip event in Guerrero, Mexico","type":"publication"},{"authors":["William B.

Using each of the detected templates in a matched-filter search, we then form event families that each represents a single source. We finally develop simple, empirical statistics to select the event families that represent LFEs. Our resulting catalog contains 1120 unique LFE sources and a total of 1,849,486 detected LFEs over the 2.5 year-long data set. The locations of the LFE sources are then divided into subcatalogs based on their distance from the subduction trench. Considering each LFE as a small unit of slip along the subduction interface, we observe discrete episodes of LFE activity in the region associated with large slow-slip events; this is in direct contrast to the near-continuous activity observed 35 km farther downdip within the previously identified LFE/tremor sweet spot.","tags":["subduction","low-frequency earthquakes","Mexico","detection","high-performance computing"],"title":"Using systematically characterized low-frequency earthquakes as a fault probe in Guerrero, Mexico","type":"publication"},{"authors":["William B.

We implement here an automated beamforming algorithm to detect LFEs within the Mexican subduction zone that can then be used as templates in a matched-filter search. Seismograms recorded on a network of seismic stations are aligned to match the moveout of a potential source at depth and their energies are then summed; any spikes in the summed energy indicate an event originating from that potential source. We apply this method to a 1-d test case and we are able to detect 381 unique, potential LFE templates.
