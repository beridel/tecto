      <description>&lt;p&gt;How deep do earthquakes occur on Earth? Deep earthquakes, generally defined as earthquakes
deeper than 70 km, are generated in a deeper portion of subduction slabs where the extremely
high pressures and temperatures make frictional slip unlikely. Seismicity in the deep Earth can
provide essential information on the physical processes that control fluid distribution within the
mantle, yet the mechanism of deep earthquakes is still enigmatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep earthquakes are categorized into two groups depending on the depth. Intermediate-depth
earthquakes generally occur at the depth range of 70-300 km, then deep-focus earthquakes
continue from 300 km.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our research group, we focus on intermediate-depth earthquakes in Colombia. The region
shows “a nest of earthquakes” where intermediate-depth earthquakes densely occur within the
10-km cube. The Bucaramanga Nest in Colombia is one of the most productive areas of
intermediate-depth earthquakes on Earth. We are curious about the mechanism of triggering
many earthquakes in a limited volume within subduction slabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, we are working on building a systematic catalog of earthquakes in the Bucaramanga
Nest. The goal of our initial project is to detect smaller events that have not been identified in the
original catalog by SGC to understand the background seismicity. After completing the catalog
making, we will work on spectral analyses to find differences between regular earthquakes in
shallow regions, slow-slip events in subduction zones, and other deep earthquakes in different
regions. By comparing the source spectra, we will identify the fundamental mechanism of deep
earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ayako was previously working on deep-focus earthquakes in Japan. After joining William’s
group, she widely pursues her curiosity about deep earthquakes. She considers a key to revealing
the mechanism of deep earthquakes buried in not only subduction zones on Earth but also other
planetary bodies such as the Moon, Mars, and even Titan. All those planets have/will have
installed man-made seismometers, and she hopes to work on those seismic data in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Slow earthquakes</title>
      <link>https://eqsci.mit.edu/tecto/research/slow_earthquakes/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earthquake sciences changed significantly in the past decades with, in particular, the discovery of slow-deformation processes in addition to ordinary earthquakes.  Those slow earthquakes play a major role in the earthquake cycle, but their physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. New methods and multi-disciplinary focused studies allow us now to expand our frontier in slow earthquake science complexity and diversity. We use geophysical methods such as InSAR analysis, geodetic solutions, and seismic catalogs as our main research tools to explore this field.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;subdaily-dynamics-of-slow-slip&#34;&gt;Subdaily dynamics of slow slip&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reproducing geodetic aseismic fault slip from low-frequency earthquake time history at high sampling rates&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slow slip events were first discovered in the early 2000s as a long-lasting release of energy visible on continuous surface motion as a reverse of the direction of motion of the GNSS station. While slow slip events are still mostly observed using GNSS surface motion, geodetic measurement only capture their long spatial- and temporal-wavelength behavior. Low-frequency earthquakes, small repeating earthquakes on the plate boundary, are often spatiotemporally correlated with slow slip, giving us the opportunity to explore slow slip dynamics at shorter time scales. Many studies highlighted the existence of a short time scale component in the complex dynamics of slow slip events using both seismic and geodetic datasets. Here, we are focusing our research on two main questions: (1) To what extent can we use low-frequency earthquake activity history to learn about slow slip short time scale dynamics? (2) What is the relationship between the aseismic slip observed by geodetic observables and the seismic slip associated with low-frequency earthquakes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our project focuses on slow slip events happening in the Guerrero region of the Mexican Subduction zone. This area is a &amp;ldquo;seismic gap&amp;rdquo;, where large megathrust earthquakes have not occurred during the last century. Because of its specific flat geometry, the rheological conditions in this region allows the occurrence of large Mw7.5 slow slip events every 4 years, and smaller Mw6.4 every more frequently. The deployement of a large seismic network crossing all Mexico between 2005 and 2008 give us the opportunity to study the seismic activity associated to the large Mw7.5 2006 slow slip event recorded by GNSS stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We explore those previous questions in this context by creating a simple fault slip model using both geodetic and seismic observables. This model is driven by the time history of low-frequency earthquakes at both daily and subdaily time scales to reproduce the geodetic record of the slow slip cycle including the large 2006 slow slip event of Guerrero. This simple approach reveals the limits of low-frequency earthquakes as a proxy to study slow slip. The slow slip cycle can be tracked by low-frequency earthquakes only when looking at individual phases of the cycle, whereas trying to modelise a full slow slip cycle needs a more complex approach. A non-linear relationship is needed between the aseismic and seismic fault slip to represent all the different phases of this slow slip cycle. We also observe that long-term loading rates on the order of plate convergence are necessary for our models to fit well the geodetic fault slip, implying 100% coupling on the plate interface at short time scales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The roles of attenuation and source&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-frequency earthquakes, atypical seismic events distinct from regular earthquakes, occur downdip of the seismogenic megathrust where an aseismic rheology dominates the subduction plate boundary. The spectra of low-frequency earthquakes are consistent with the classical earthquake model, yet their rupture duration and stress drop are orders of magnitude different from ordinary earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;fig_qy1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nankai Trough, where low frequency earthquakes were first observed, is monitored by a long-term borehole monitoring network that has recorded low-frequency earthquakes in the same epicentral area as both crustal and intraslab earthquakes. We focus on two depth columns directly beneath two seismic stations where the subduction interface is sandwiched between earthquakes above and below, with one depth column hosting low-frequency earthquakes and the other not. With this unique seismic geometry, we investigate the endmember possibilities of attenuation experienced by low-frequency earthquakes to isolate their source process. Through this natural controlled experiment, we place key constraints on the character of the low-frequency earthquake source to address the outstanding question: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;what makes low-frequency earthquakes low frequency?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observe that the source regions of the low frequency earthquakes are marked by high pore fluid pressure indicated by high &lt;em&gt;Qp/Qs&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Vp/Vs&lt;/em&gt; ratios. This suggests that local variations in the rheology of this transitional zone, just downdip of where major earthquakes occur and where slow fault slip dominates the tectonic slip budget, are responsible for earthquakes that rupture an order of magnitude more slowly than is typical. An atypical rupture mechanism associated with this rheology, likely governed by processes linked to saturated fault conditions at the plate boundary, is necessary to explain the low-frequency earthquake source. We conclude their low-frequency nature primarily results from an atypical seismic rupture process rather than near-source attenuation. Attenuation is not what makes low-frequency earthquakes low frequency.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Volcanoes</title>
      <link>https://eqsci.mit.edu/tecto/research/volcanoes/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Aug 2022 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reliable forecasts of volcanic activity rely on observations of where magma is stored within the lithosphere and how it migrates from its mantle source towards the surface. Over the last decade, conceptual models of magma storage have shifted from a single long-lived magma chamber to a vertically extensive, structurally complex, and rapidly evolving plumbing system. This complexity emphasizes the need for detailed images of magma storage, as well as continuous monitoring of magma transport. We are developing new observational methods to capture the 4D evolution of active magmatic plumbing systems.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;seismic-monitoring-of-magmatic-systems&#34;&gt;Seismic Monitoring of Magmatic Systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measuring seismic velocity changes from the magma source to the surface&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
Most volcanic activity is driven by influx of melt from the mantle, but geophysical methods like seismic velocity monitoring are often only sensitive to the uppermost crust. Furthermore, few earthquakes occur in the lower crust and most magma transport is aseismic, so our observations of active processes at the roots of magmatic systems are sparse. We developed a seismic monitoring method based on teleseismic receiver functions which can sense velocity changes throughout the crust and does not require local sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We applied this receiver function monitoring approach to a quiescent period at Mount St. Helens. Taking advantage of the subduction zone setting of the volcano, our strategy is to measure the volcano&amp;rsquo;s response to periodic external forcing from slow slip events on the Cascadia megathrust. The idea is that magma-rich materials will be weaker and more sensitive to external forcing, so measuring the velocity change can act as a probe for the rheology of different parts of the magmatic plumbing system. We plan to apply this method next to an active volcano with mutliple instrumented eruptions. This will allow us to track magma transport and storage from the mantle source to the upper crustal magma chambers. Our goal is to gain new insight into deep magma transport and storage, and to link these processes to signs of impending eruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
