      <title>FastMatchedFilter (FMF)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Matched-filter searches are an important tool in modern seismology to detect seismic events.
They operate via an algorithm that computes the correlation coefficient between a template event and a sliding window of continuous seismic records.
A detection is recorded when the correlation coefficient crosses an established threshold.
We present an optimized program, called Fast Matched Filter (FMF), that efficiently runs a network-based matched-filter search with either central processing units (CPUs) or Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs).
Wrappers for both Python and MATLAB (CPU only) are pro- vided to easily run FMF on a wide range of computational resources, from multicore laptops to specialized computing clusters with GPUs.
Both implementations leverage a significantly similar structure when it comes to the continuous com- putation of correlation coefficients in the time domain to achieve rapid performance.
The highly parallel architecture of GPUs lends itself perfectly to the matched-filter algorithm, and we achieve the fastest run times with our GPU implementation.
FMF allows for seismic network-based matched-filtering between a large set of template waveforms and a large continuous dataset in a reasonable amount of time.
Such fast run times are an important step in expanding the scope of earthquake detection and fostering the reproducibility of such studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use FMF in your own research, please reference the above article.&lt;/p&gt;
